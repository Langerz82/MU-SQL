# MuMySQL
MuOnline - MySQL - Project for migrating all old MSSQL over to MySQL.

Would anyone be interested in creating a github with the source from here and try to convert it into a Linux/MySQL Server? Its very possible and I am a decent programmer I just need help with the tedious jobs, such as converting the Stored Procedures over.

edit:
Actually we could make it a console application that supports both Windows/Linux and MySQL.

The Main reason I want to do this is to keep costs down in NOT using licensed software. The original developers could benefit too as they will be able to use the source for there more recent versions and still maintain there piece of cake.

What do you think?
